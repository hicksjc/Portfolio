                <h3>Design + Development</h3>
                <p>I have been on a couple of projects wehre design and development has been a priority. Not only have I got the chance to work on making UI better but have also had the opportunity on implementing CRUD methods into a team project as well as develop an API server from scratch with the help of a couple of teammates.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
                <p>Throughout these few development projects responsiveness and design has been a priority for some. The ability to make a website responsive to the changing of a viewport size isn't easy but when it is done it can be not only refreshing for the programmer but also easier to understand for the viewer. It allows the viewer to be able to increase the size of text to see better, and changes several aspects of the site itself to compensate for a smaller or larger viewport size.</p>

            <div class="service">
                <h3>Teamwork + Debugging</h3>
                <p>One of the things that I enjoy most about what I do is working with other people and helping other people when they have issues. I live for the relief after the frustration of a problem, the "eureka" moment after a long days work of trying to figure out a problem. I also enjoy the satisfaction of working with a team, I like knowing that there is someone that I can contact for help if I am struggling with something.</p>
